# unused-unloved

🌳Tree shaking is great but what happens when you have so many 📁files in your dev environment you can't remember which ones are actually in use😵🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ and those that are currently dormant? 
*Time for some spring cleaning, enter...* **unused-unloved**🎉🎉 !

Once unused-unloved has run it will output an 📄*unused-file-report.json*

You can now use the contents of this folder to do as you wish, personally, I suggest copy and paste it into [http://json2table.com/](http://json2table.com/)
  

## Getting started is simple:

    npm install -g unused-unloved

### running is just as simple... 
Open your React (or similar) project and make sure you are the same level as your **/src** folder and just run:

    unused-unloved
    
## Enjoy! 😁🙌
